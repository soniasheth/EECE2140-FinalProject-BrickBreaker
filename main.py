Will be a a large while loop that utilizes the functions to run the game

def check_key_input():
    '''
    Inputs: 
    Outputs: String, returns the specific key that is being pressed 

    Will check if there is a key pressed and if so, which one

    '''
    Inputs: 
    Outputs: Boolean, returns the specific ke that is being pressed 

    Will check if there is a key pressed and if so, which one

    pass

def check_collsion_brick():

    '''
    Inputs: 
    Outputs: 

    Will check if the ball has collided with any brick in the board or not
    If so, need to access the brick array and delete it
    AND access the x and y coordinte of the the ball to redirect its movement

    '''

    Inputs: 
    Outputs: 

    Will check if the ball collided with the paddle 
    If so, need to access the x and y coodindate of the ball and change them to redirect the ball movement

    pass

def done():
    '''
    Inputs: 
    Outputs: Boolean, whether the game is done or not 

    Will check if the ball goes below the lowest y coordinate (PLAYER LOSES) OR if all the bricks are done (PLAYER WINS)
